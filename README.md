2020HTML

First HTML school project from 2020

My first time coding was when I took a class on intro to HTML and CSS during fall quarter of 2020. This was an eye opener to me as, I enjoyed every assignment and project that we have done. After the fall quarter class, I knew back then that I wanted to be a web developer. While this needs a lot of work, I'm still proud of what I have accomplished, even adding the menu button that I had to research just to apply it.
